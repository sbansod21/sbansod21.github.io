          Hello! My name is Sushruti Bansod. I go by Sush and my pronouns are
          She/her. I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh. My
          aniticipated graduation December 2021. I am majoring in computer
          science and I am also pursuing a certificate in ASL.

          <p data-aos="zoom-in-up" >I am a aspiring Software Engineer and my goal is to create an 
          impact in the tech community. I am passionate about inclusivity 
          within this community. My previous experiences - which vary from coding 
          algorithms in Java and C to finding cultural differences between signed 
          language dialects for dataset creation - have helped me improve 
          effective communication, adaptability, leadership, and attention to detail.

            Cathy cash is a money managing app targetted for students at the University of Pittsburgh. 
            It has features such as targetted spending on specific amenities, rewards for meeting 
            set targets as well as connection to the student account at Pitt to use university funds 
            such as Panther funds and Dining dollars.
            This program was done using MIT App Inventor. My contribution to this project included 
            helping with the back-end algorithm and the user interface of the app.

            APPrentice is a interview prep tool. This program will allow the user to choose what career 
            they want to prep for. Then there is an option for behavioral and technical problems. 
            The user had the ability to enter an answer that is graded with respect to word count and certain keywords. 

            This program was done using Java and my contribution to it was most of the back end code.

            Jukebox is a study tool that can be used to increase focus. Studies show that certain 
            music allows students to perform better in certain tasks. We used the spoify API which allowed us
            to measure the "dancability" of each song. We then divided the songs into certan sections. Our program
            allows the user to pick the activity that they are doing, and music is played based on our research.

            This program was done using Python and HTML. I contributed to the back end of the program as well as the spotify API.

          <p>
            A class project required us to design a game of astroids using MIPS. Where "rockets" or rather
            objects shoot bullets at floating astriods. These astoids vary in size, shape and direction of 
            movement. Each object takes a different number of bullets to destroy. In order to win, all astroids
            must be destroyed before loosing all livess. 
            I designed this whole game independently with help from resources provided by the instructor.

            A class project required us to implement multiple graphing algorithms as taught in class.
            Using extra time before the submission deadline, I learned how to use the JOptionPane as a
            gui. The projram allows user to find flights from one location to another using certain criteria.
            This can include, shortest distance, cheapest etc.
            I designed this whole program independently with help from resources provided by the instructor.
